# Black Cats Matters

A little game made with JS + jQuery as a diploma project at Yandex web development course. You have a field of 12 cards, each card has a pair. Paired cards remain face up, unpaired cards are flipped back. You need to open all the paired cards (by clicking on them) in 1 minute. 

To run the game just run <code>npm start</code> from the root folder. Have fun!

P.S. Black cats are awesome!)
